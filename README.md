##DonkeyCar, RaspberryPi, and Balena

This repo installs the popular DonkeyCar autonomous vehicle / self-driving bot platform into a container, ready to be deployed on a balena device like a Raspberry Pi.

There are several components to cover:
- Hardware
- Software
- Using the Container

Also keep in mind that this Readme only covers the Balena-specific bits, but the proper DonkeyCar documentation covers many more topics, and in much greater detail.

##TO-DO - Update this Readme
